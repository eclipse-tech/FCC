# FCC

The objective of this project is to find various patterns in buying behavior of the contractor which we can leverage for different applications.

Benefit:
- Build understanding of creating Cohorts of Contractors by geography, establish demand centers( micro markets within markets). We would get to know What he is buying, from Where he is buying and When he is buying materials.
- Understand FCC app behavior, sections used, time and frequency of usage, who uses it (in case of hierarchy) 
- Build proxies using ML to link usage of pidilite products to Total budget, kind of material used, Clusters of micro mini markets (using Geotag and understanding high demand centers in a dense location e.g. Prestige city). This will provide inputs to our Catalog as well especially influencing the buying behavior
- Create proxy analysis like creating home interior index 
- Build predictive models for demand forecast and contractor upcoming needs.

This will greatly help us when we want to explore untapped cities and states.
